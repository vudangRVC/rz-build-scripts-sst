# RZG2L SBC board #
This is the quick startup guide for RZG2L SBC board (hereinafter referred to as `RZG2L-SBC`).
The below will describe the current status of development, how to build, set up environment for RZG2L-SBC.

## Status
This is a Ubuntu release of the RZG2L development product for RZG2L-SBC.

This release provides the following features:

 - Ubuntu build compatible with RZG2L SoC
 - RZG2L-SBC Linux BSP functionalities
 - 40 IO expansion interface supported
 - On-board Wireless Modules enabled (only support for Wi-Fi)
 - On-board Audio Codec with Stereo Jack Analog Audio IO
 - Generic USB Bluetooth framework supported
 - MIPI DSI enabled
 - Bootloader with U-Boot Fastboot UDP enabled.

Known issues:

 - Only support for 48 Khz audio sampling rate family.

## Building Ubuntu
**Step 1**: Linux Ubuntu 22.04 is recommended for the build. Prepare environment for building package and local build environment.
Before starting the build, prepare a file named `core-image-qt-rzpi.tar.bz2`, which is the output from core-image-qt in yocto build and place in the same level of `main_script.sh`.

User can modify the target wic/rootfs size, name, time zone and version of ubuntu base inside `config.ini`.

Run the command below on the Linux Host PC to install packages to be used.
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib \
build-essential chrpath socat cpio python python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect \
xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping libsdl1.2-dev xterm p7zip-full
```

Run the below commands to set the user name and email address before starting the build procedure.
```
$ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
**Step 2**: Build package
First, we need to change the permisstions of `main_script.sh` to make it executable.
Then we can execute the script as follows:
```
chmod +x main_script.sh
./main_script.sh
```
**Note:**
Please note that this build requires internet access and will take several hours.

**Step 3**: Collect the output

After building Ubuntu, the output can be collected as `*.tar.zst` and `*.wic` (compression file is `*.wic.tar.gz)

**Note:**
Please note that file name is modified by users in `config.ini`.

```

## Confirm supported features on RZG2L-SBC
### 40 IO expansion interface settings

The 40 IO Expansion Interface on RZG2L-SBC supports for I2C channel 0 and channel 3, SPI channel 0, SCIF channel 0, CAN channel 0 and channel 1 and GPIO pin-function (default).

By default, I2C channel 0 and SCIF channel 0 are enabled. Users can configure to use other channels.

We support an FDT overlays appoach to easily reconfigure for this Expansion Interface.

The specific description is as follows:

```
## For RZ SBC U-Boot Env
/------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------
|       Config                 | Value if set |     To be loading
|------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------
| enable_overlay_i2c           | '1' or 'yes' |  rzpi-ext-i2c.dtbo
|------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------
| enable_overlay_spi           | '1' or 'yes' |  rzpi-ext-spi.dtbo
|------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------
| enable_overlay_can           | '1' or 'yes' |  rzpi-can.dtbo
|------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------
| enable_overlay_dsi           | '1' or 'yes' |  rzpi-dsi.dtbo
|------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------
| enable_overlay_csi_ov5640    | '1' or 'yes' |  rzpi-ov5640.dtbo
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| fdtfile   : is a base dtb file, should be set rzpi.dtb
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| uboot env : you could set U-Boot's environment variables here, such as 'console=' 'bootargs='
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

default settings:
    fdtfile=rzpi.dtb
    #enable_overlay_i2c=1
    #enable_overlay_spi=1
    #enable_overlay_can=1
    #enable_overlay_dsi=1
    #enable_overlay_csi_ov5640=1
```

You can refer to the `readme.txt` file in `/boot` folder for the FDT overlays information.

After changing the value of overlays options, we need to run `sync` to ensure that the changes are affected. Then, execute `reboot` to apply the changes.

The below section shows how to configure for each GPIO function:

#### GPIO

System uses /sys/class/gpio to control the GPIO pin, please refer to the following table:

```

pinum = $group * $groupin + $pin + $pinbase (where pinbase=120, groupin=8)

Example for J3 PIN 7:
                              23*8 + 0 + 120 = 304 = pinum

To set GPIO pin, move to GPIO sysfs directory and set values as shown below:

```
root@rzpi:~# cd /sys/class/gpio/
root@rzpi:~# echo 304 > export
root@rzpi:~# echo out > P23_0/direction
root@rzpi:~# echo 1 > P23_0/value
root@rzpi:~# echo 0 > P23_0/value
```

#### I2C function (channel 3 - RIIC3)

You should edit `uEnv.txt` as follows to enable I2C channel 3 on 40 IO expansion interface:

```
enable_overlay_i2c=1
```

To check the I2C channel 3 is enabled or not, run the following command and check the result:

```
root@rzpi:~# i2cdetect -l
i2c-3   i2c             Renesas RIIC adapter                    I2C adapter
i2c-1   i2c             Renesas RIIC adapter                    I2C adapter
i2c-4   i2c             i2c-1-mux (chan_id 0)                   I2C adapter
i2c-0   i2c             Renesas RIIC adapter                    I2C adapter
root@rzpi:~#
```

You can also check devices existance on I2C bus by running the following command:

```
root@rzpi:~# i2cdetect -y -r 3
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

50: 50 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
```

#### SPI function (channel 0 - RSPI0)

You should edit `uEnv.txt` as follows to enable SPI channel 0 on 40 IO expansion interface:

```
enable_overlay_spi=1
```

Run the following command to config the SPI:

```
root@rzpi:~# spi-config -d /dev/spidev0.0 -q
/dev/spidev0.0: mode=0, lsb=0, bits=8, speed=2000000, spiready=0
```

Connect Pin 19 (RSPI0 MOSI) to Pin 21 (RSPI0 MISO), then run the below command and check the result:

```
root@rzpi:~# echo -n -e "1234567890" | spi-pipe -d /dev/spidev0.0 -s 10000000 | hexdump
0000000 3231 3433 3635 3837 3039
000000a
```

#### CAN function (channel 0,1 - CAN0, CAN1)

You should edit `uEnv.txt` as follows to enable CAN channel 0,1 on 40 IO expansion interface:

```
enable_overlay_can=1
```

To check the CAN channels are enabled or not, run the following command and check the result:

```
root@rzpi:~# ip a | grep can
3: can0: <NOARP,ECHO> mtu 16 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 10
    link/can
4: can1: <NOARP,ECHO> mtu 16 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 10
    link/can
root@rzpi:~#
```

Then set up for CAN devices. Now you can up/down or send data from CAN channels.

The below shows the communication between two CAN channels.
```
root@rzpi:~# ip link set can0 down
root@rzpi:~# ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
root@rzpi:~# ip link set can0 up

```

**Please note that before using Wi-Fi feature on RZG2L-SBC, the ethernet connections need to be down.**

```
root@rzpi:~# ifconfig eth0 down
root@rzpi:~# ifconfig eth1 down
```
### On-board Audio Codec with Stereo Jack Analog Audio IO configurations

RZG2L-SBC has an On-board Audio Codec - DA7219. It is the default audio device of RZG2L-SBC
and it will be enabled automatically when the system comes up.

Before playing an audio file, connect an audio device such as 3.5mm headset to J8.

Run the following commands to play an audio file:

```
root@rzpi:~# aplay /home/root/audios/04_16KH_2ch_bgm_maoudamashii_healing01.wav
root@rzpi:~# gst-play-1.0 /home/root/audios/COMMON6_MPEG2_L3_24KHZ_160_2.mp3
```

`aplay` command supports `wav` format audio files

`gst-play-1.0` command supports `wav`, `mp3` and `aac` formats

To perform a recording, run the following command to record audio to an `audio_capture.wav` file:

```
root@rzpi:~# arecord -f S16_LE -r 48000 audio_capture.wav
```

Press Ctrl+C if you want to stop recording.

In the above command:

-f S16_LE : audio format

-r 48000  : sample rate of the audio file (48KHz)

To verify the recorded file, you can play it by the following command:

```
root@rzpi:~# aplay audio_capture.wav
```

To adjust the level of the audio record/playback, use the following command to open the ALSA mixer GUI:

```
root@rzpi:~# alsamixer
```
### MIPI DSI with display panels

RZG2L-SBC supports the MIPI DSI interface and the Waveshare 5 inch Touchscreen Monitor MIPI-DSI LCD is enabled and tested.

You should edit `uEnv.txt` as follows to enable MIPI DSI interface with the panel supported:

```
enable_overlay_dsi=1
```

**Please note that selecting the MIPI DSI display will cause the HDMI display be disabled.**

### Generic USB Bluetooth framework

The RZG2L-SBC supports the generic USB Bluetooth framework, which is back-ported from the Linux kernel mainline. TP-Link UB500 Bluetooth 5.0 Nano USB Adapter (Realtek chipset) has been tested and proven to work on the board.

The following steps will guide how to enable the TP-Link UB500 adapter:

- Step 1: Download the appropriate firmware for the TP-Link UB500 adapter and store it on the RZG2L-SBC. This will ensure it is loaded each time the board boots (one-time setup).

```shell
root@rzpi:~# mkdir -p /lib/firmware/rtl_bt
root@rzpi:~# curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Realtek-OpenSource/android_hardware_realtek/rtk1395/bt/rtkbt/Firmware/BT/rtl8761b_fw -o /lib/firmware/rtl_bt/rtl8761bu_fw.bin
```
**Note:**
**(1) Please make sure you have internet access before running the commands.**
**(2) If the firmware is being downloaded for the first time, a reboot of the board is required to ensure the TP-Link UB500 adapter functions properly.**

- Step 2: Verify whether the TP-Link UB500 adapter is properly attached.

Run the following command to ensure that the system has recognized the TP-Link UB500 adapter:

```shell
root@rzpi:~# hciconfig hci0 -a
hci0:   Type: Primary  Bus: USB
        BD Address: E8:48:B8:C8:20:00  ACL MTU: 1021:5  SCO MTU: 255:11

        LMP Version: 5.1 (0xa)  Subversion: 0xd922
        Manufacturer: Realtek Semiconductor Corporation (93)
```

The TP-Link UB500 adapter is now ready to connect.

- Step 3: Connect Bluetooth Device

Use `bluetoothctl` to connect Bluetooth Device:

```Shell
root@rzpi:~# bluetoothctl
[bluetooth]# power on
[bluetooth]# pairable on
[bluetooth]# agent on
[bluetooth]# default-agent
```

Set the RZG2L-SBC to be discoverable by other Bluetooth devices:

```Shell
[bluetooth]# discoverable on
```

Enable and disable scan function:

```Shell
[bluetooth]# scan on
[bluetooth]# scan off
```

Pair and connect the device:

```Shell
[bluetooth]# pair FC:02:96:A5:80:97
[bluetooth]# trust FC:02:96:A5:80:97
[bluetooth]# connect FC:02:96:A5:80:97
```

`FC:02:96:A5:80:97` is the address of the Bluetooth device. Please change it to match your device’s address.

Exit `bluetoothctl`.

```Shell
[Mi Sports BT]# quit
```

#### Send files over Bluetooth

To share files between the RZG2L-SBC and the target Bluetooth device, run the obexctl daemon and connect:

```Shell
root@rzpi:~# export $(dbus-launch)
root@rzpi:~# /usr/libexec/bluetooth/obexd -r /home/root -a -d & obexctl

```

In this example, a text file names `uEnv.txt` which is located at `/boot` is sent to the target Bluetooth device.

### Package Management

The distribution comes with Debian package manager `apt-get` and `dpkg` for binary package handling.

#### Setting up Debian as a backend source
The default configuration for the `sources.list` file, which defines the package repositories, is as follows:

```
deb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ focal main multiverse universe
deb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ focal-security main multiverse universe
deb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ focal-backports main multiverse universe
deb [arch=arm64] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ focal-updates main multiverse universe
```

#### Configuring the Debian package repository

`sources.list` is a critical configuration file for packages installation and updates used by package managers on Debian-based Linux distributions. The `sources.list` file contains a list of URLs or repository addresses where the package manager can find software packages. These repositories may be maintained by the Linux distribution itself or by third-party individuals or organizations.

The file is located at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/sources.list`. You can modify it to add or change the repositories according to your needs.

After configuring the APT repositories, refresh the package database by running:

```
root@rzpi:~# apt-get update
```

**Please make sure you have internet access before running `apt-get update`.**

This command refreshes the package database and ensures that your system is aware of the latest available packages from the configured repositories.

In the contents of `sources.list` file, you can see `[arch=arm64]` on each line. This is because the RZG2L-SBC's architecture is aarch64, as indicated by the output of the `lscpu` command:

```
root@rzpi:~# lscpu
Architecture:                    aarch64
CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
Byte Order:                      Little Endian
CPU(s):                          2
...
Vendor ID:                       ARM
```

So we need to specify `[arch=arm64]` in `sources.list` file to filter the binary packages in the repository.

This specification is to limit the existing APT sources to arm64 only, so APT won't try to fetch packages for other architectures from the existing repository.

However, if we use a repository which is already designed for ARM architectures, we don't need to specify `[arch=arm64]`. For example:

```
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main contrib non-free
```

Remember that sources doesn’t have to be a single origin. It's very common to add multiple repositories and sources for packages and manage them using keys.

The source management is beyond the scope of this document.

#### Using `apt-get` to install packages

To install a package using `apt-get`, use the following command:

```
root@rzpi:~# apt-get install <package-name>
```

#### Using `DPKG` to install packages

The utility `dpkg` is the low-level package manager for Debian-based systems. It is the local systemwide package manager. It handles installation, removal, provisioning about package.deb file, indexing and other aspects of packages installed on the system. However, it does not perform any cloud operations. Dpkg also doesn’t handle dependency resolution. This is another task handled by a high-level manager like `apt-get`. In fact, `dpkg` is the backend for `apt-get`. While `apt-get` handles fetching and indexing, the local installations and management of the packages are performed by the `dpkg` manager.

Basic `dpkg` commands:

- `dpkg -i <package.deb>`: Installs a `package.deb` package.
- `dpkg -r <package>`: Removes a package.
- `dpkg -l <pattern>`: Lists installed packages matching `<pattern>`.
- `dpkg -s <package>`: Provides information about an installed package.

You can install `package.deb` using `dpkg` with the following command:

```
root@rzpi:~# dpkg -i <package.deb>
```

After installing a package using dpkg, if you need to resolve dependency issues, use the following command:

```
root@rzpi:~# apt-get install -f
```

### Network Boot and TFTP
This section outlines the process for network booting using TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol). It includes configuration steps and commands necessary for a successful setup.

Network booting allows devices to boot from an image stored on a network server, rather than relying on local storage.

#### TFTP server setup
This subsection covers the setup of a TFTP server, which is necessary for the device to retrieve the boot images over the network.

- Step 1: Install a TFTP server using the following command:

  ```shell
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install tftpd-hpa
  ```

- Step 2: Create a TFTP directory and set the appropriate permissions.

  ```shell
  $ sudo mkdir /tftpboot
  $ sudo chmod 755 /tftpboot
  ```

- Step 3: Edit the TFTP configuration file (typically found at /etc/default/tftpd-hpa) and set it up as follows:

  ```shell
  # /etc/default/tftpd-hpa
  TFTP_USERNAME="<tftp_name>"
  TFTP_DIRECTORY="</path/to/your/tftp_folder"
  TFTP_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0:69"
  TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure"
  ```

  For example:
  ```shell
  # /etc/default/tftpd-hpa
  TFTP_USERNAME="tftp"
  TFTP_DIRECTORY="/tftpboot"
  TFTP_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0:69"
  TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure"
  ```

- Step 4: Restart the TFTP service to apply the changes.

  ```shell
  $ sudo systemctl restart tftpd-hpa
  ```

  Make sure the tftpd-hpa service is running:

  ```shell
  $ sudo systemctl status tftpd-hpa
  ```

#### NFS server setup

NFS (Network File System) is a protocol that allows clients to access files over a network as if they were local. It enables multiple clients to share files from a central server, simplifying file management across machines.

In this setup, NFS will share the root filesystem (rootfs) with clients booting over the network. This allows client devices to dynamically retrieve their operating system files and configurations, making it ideal for embedded systems that require consistent file access without local storage.

- Step 1: Install NFS server and NFS client package if it's not already installed on your host PC:
  ```shell
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server nfs-common
  ```

- Step 2: Edit the `/etc/exports` file to specify the directories to be shared and their access permissions.
  ```shell
  $ vi /etc/exports
  ```

  For example, to share the `/tftpboot` directory, add the following line:

  ```shell
  /tftpboot *(rw,no_root_squash,async)
  ```

  Here, * allows access from any client. Consider replacing it with specific client IP addresses for better security.

- Step 3: After editing `/etc/exports`, run the following command to export the directories:

  ```shell
  $ sudo exportfs -a
  ```

- Step 4: Start the NFS server and enable it to run at boot:
  ```shell
  $ sudo systemctl start nfs-kernel-server
  $ sudo systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server
  ```

#### U-Boot DHCP IP Configuration

In this subsection, the U-Boot environment will be configured for network settings, including the specification of the Ethernet device and the configuration of the server and device IP addresses.

- Step 1: Enter the U-Boot interactive command prompt for configuration by pressing any key when prompted with `Hit any key to stop autoboot`:


  ```shell
  U-Boot 2021.10 (May 24 2024 - 07:26:08 +0000)

  CPU:   Renesas Electronics CPU rev 1.0
  Model: RZpi
  DRAM:  896 MiB
  MMC:   sd@11c00000: 0
  Loading Environment from SPIFlash... SF: Detected is25wp256 with page size 256 Bytes, erase size 4 KiB, total 32 MiB

  Out:   serial@1004b800
  Err:   serial@1004b800
  Net:   eth0: ethernet@11c20000, eth1: ethernet@11c30000
  Hit any key to stop autoboot:  0
  =>
  =>
  ```

- Step 2: Enter Specify the Ethernet device (eth1) to use for the network connection. For example,

  ```shell
  => setenv ethact ethernet@11c30000
  ```

- Step 3: Configure server and device IPs:

  ```shell
  => setenv serverip <server_ip>
  => setenv ipaddr <device_ip>
  ```

  For example:
  ```shell
  => setenv serverip 192.168.5.86
  => setenv ipaddr 192.168.5.30
  ```

##### TFTP Boot

In this subsection, the boot arguments and commands for U-Boot will be configured to load the kernel image and device tree from the TFTP server.

Step 1: After setting up the TFTP server, you need to ensure that the necessary boot images, including the kernel image, device tree blob (DTB), device tree overlay (DTBO), and root file system, are placed in the TFTP directory.

```shell
renesas@builder-pc:/tftpboot/rzsbc/$ tree -L 2
.
├── Image
├── overlays
│   ├── rzpi-can.dtbo
│   ├── rzpi-dsi.dtbo
│   ├── rzpi-ext-i2c.dtbo
│   ├── rzpi-ext-spi.dtbo
│   └── rzpi-ov5640.dtbo
├── rootfs
│   ├── bin -> usr/bin
│   ├── boot
│   ├── dev
│   ├── etc

│   ├── snap
│   ├── srv
│   ├── sys
│   ├── tmp
│   ├── usr
│   └── var
└── rzpi.dtb
```
- Step 2: Define the boot arguments to specify the network and root file system settings:

  ```shell
  => setenv bootargs 'consoleblank=0 strict-devmem=0 ip=<device_ip>:<server_ip>::::<eth_device> root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=<server_ip>:</path/to/your/rootfs>,v3,tcp' 
  ```

  For example:
  ```shell
  => setenv bootargs 'consoleblank=0 strict-devmem=0 ip=192.168.5.30:192.168.5.86::::eth1 root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=192.168.5.86:/tftpboot/rzsbc/rootfs,v3,tcp'
  ```

- Step 3: Configure the boot command to load the kernel image and device tree files.

  ```shell
  => setenv bootcmd 'tftp <load_address_kernel> <path/to/kernel_image>; tftp <load_address_dtb> <path/to/device_tree_blob>; tftp <load_address_dtbo> <path/to/dtbo file>; booti <load_address_kernel> - <load_address_dtb> - <load_address_dtbo>'
  ```

  For example load `Image`, `rzpi.dtb` and `rzpi-ext-spi.dtbo` files.
  ```shell
  => setenv bootcmd 'tftp 0x48080000 rzsbc/Image; tftp 0x48000000 rzsbc/rzpi.dtb; tftp 0x48010000 rzsbc/overlays/rzpi-ext-spi.dtbo; booti 0x48080000 - 0x48000000 - 0x48010000'
  ```

- Step 4: Save the changes to the environment variables so they persist across reboots:

  ```shell
  => saveenv
  ```

- Step 5: Initiate the boot progress by running bootcmd:

  ```shell
  run bootcmd
  ```

  If everything is set up correctly, the images will be booted from the network.

  ```
  => run bootcmd

### Using SSH and SCP for Remote Access and File Transfers

This section explains how to use SSH (Secure Shell) for secure remote access to the RZ/G2L-SBC and how to utilize SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) for file transfers. By default, OpenSSH is employed as it is a feature-rich and widely used SSH implementation that offers advanced capabilities for secure communication. While OpenSSH serves as the default option, Dropbear SSH can be considered for lightweight, resource-constrained environments making it particularly suitable for embedded systems.

#### Differences Between Dropbear and OpenSSH
- **Resource Usage**: Dropbear is optimized for lower resource usage, making it ideal for embedded systems.
- **Feature Set**: OpenSSH has a more extensive feature set, including advanced options for authentication and configuration.
- **Key Authentication**: OpenSSH requires the use of SSH keys for authentication, while Dropbear can operate with both keys and passwords.

#### Using OpenSSH

OpenSSH is a widely-used, full-featured SSH implementation that provides encrypted communication between hosts. It supports advanced authentication methods and secure remote administration, making it ideal for robust network security.

The RZ/G2L-SBC supports both password and key-based authentication methods. To enhance security by enforcing SSH key-based login, follow these steps to switch to key-based authentication:

- Step 1: Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine, run the following command to generate a secure SSH key pair:

  ```shell
  $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
  ```

  - Step 2: Copying an SSH public key to the board using SSH, transfer your public key to the board with this command:

  ```shell
  $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh username@remote_host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
  ```
  For example:

  ```shell
  $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh root@192.168.5.30 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
  ```

- Step 3: Authenticate using SSH keys:

  ```shell
  $ ssh root@192.168.5.30
  ```

  If this is the first time connecting to this host (as mentioned in the previous method), a message similar to the following may appear:

  ```shell
  $ The authenticity of host 192.169.5.30 (192.168.5.30)' can't be established.
  ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:esQPI0Ip9HZH9A6dvTsA9+k7eLjT4sqzpiF7znl0tyw.
  This key is not known by any other names
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
  ```

  This indicates that the local computer does not recognize the remote host. Type `yes` and press `ENTER` key to proceed.

- Step 4: Disable password authentication. If login to your account using SSH is successful without a password, SSH key-based authentication has been correctly configured. However, password-based authentication remains active, which leaves the server vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

  Once the SSH connection is established, open the SSH daemon's configuration file:

  ```shell
  $ vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  ```

  Inside the file, search for a directive called `PasswordAuthentication`. This may be commented out. Uncomment the line by removing any # at the beginning of the line, and set the value to `no`. This will disable your ability to log in through SSH using account passwords: /etc/ssh/sshd

  ```shell
  PasswordAuthentication no
  ```

- Step 5: Restart the SSH service to apply the changes:
  ```shell
  $ systemctl restart ssh
  ```

#### SSH Access

After configuring the authentication key, access to the RZ/G2L-SBC via SSH can be achieved using various tools available on both Windows and Linux platforms.

1. **SSH from Windows host**
   - **Using Git Bash**:
        - Install Git for Windows if you haven't already.
        - Use the following command:
            ```shell
            $ ssh username@<device_ip>
            ```
            For example:
            ```shell
            $ ssh root@192.168.5.30
            ```
        - Type `yes` to confirm the host's authenticity when prompted.
          ```shell
          $ ssh root@192.168.5.30
          The authenticity of host '192.168.5.30 (192.168.5.30)' can't be established.
          RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:v39PhjNp4F7HcQpwJmfNOYcC+ZZ3Yw8i1ICsL2mXUgg.
          This key is not known by any other names.
          Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
          Warning: Permanently added '192.168.5.30' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
          ```

   - **Using MobaXTerm**:
        - Download and install MobaXterm.
        - Select "Session" > "SSH" and enter the device's IP address.
        - Confirm the host's authenticity if prompted.

2. **SSH from Linux host**
    - Open a terminal and run
        ```shell
        $ ssh username@<device_ip>
        ```
        For example:
        ```shell
        $ ssh root@192.168.5.30
        ```
    - Type `yes` to confirm the host's authenticity when prompted.

#### SCP (Secure Copy)

To securely transfer files between local and remote systems, SCP can be used on both Windows and Linux.

1. **SCP from Windows host**
   - **Using Git Bash**:
     - Install Git for Windows if you haven't already.
     - Use the following command:
       ```shell
       $ scp <local_file> username@<device_ip>:<remote_path>
       ```
       For example:
       ```shell
       $ scp hello-world root@192.168.5.30:home/root
       ```
     - Type `yes` to confirm the host's authenticity when prompted.

   - **Using WinSCP**:
     - Open WinSCP and select "New Session"
     - Choose SCP as protocol then enter the remote device's IP address and the user name.
     - Click "Login" and choose yes to confirm the host's authenticity when prompted.
     - Drag and drop files between your local machine (Left) and the target board (Right) to transfer.

2. **SCP from Linux host**
   - Use the following command:
      ```shell
      $ scp <local_file> username@<device_ip>:<remote_path>
      ```
     For example:
      ```shell
      $ scp hello-world root@192.168.5.30:home/root
      ```
   - Type `yes` to confirm the host's authenticity when prompted.
